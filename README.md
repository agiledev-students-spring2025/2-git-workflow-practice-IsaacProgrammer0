I thought that this article was interesting because it really showed me that some of the tools that I've already used before can make something as successful as instragram. It was interesting to learn about what the early developers used for frontend, backend, storage, and hosting. Overall, the article is very motivational because it really shows how anything is possible if you know how to code and software engineer things.
