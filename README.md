I thought that this article was interesting because it really showed me that some of the tools that I've already used before can make something as successful as instragram. It was interesting to learn about what the early developers used for frontend, backend, storage, and hosting. Overall, the article is very motivational because it really shows how anything is possible if you know how to code and software engineer things.

##Chelsea's Comment

I thought the scaling article was cool because rarely before emplyement would I see the differences between small apps for grading and an app that needs to be functional for millions at any given time. Also was interesting to see some of the specific platforms used like Gearman or Redis.
